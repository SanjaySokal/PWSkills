1. Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time.

2. Variables is a memory location where we can store some value with assigning the name of that particular pcale where we are storing the value.

3. In Java, firstly we have to define the datatype of the value and then name that the variable and assign a value to that variable.

4. Primitive data types which includes byte , short , int , long , float , double , boolean and char.

5. Identifiers are the name of the variable in which are we are storing data.

6. Operators
    a. Assignment Operator
    b. Arithmetic Operators
    c. Conditional Operators
    d. Relational Operators

7. If we have to increase one to a variable then it is called as increment.
    example: int a = 5; a++; // new value of "a" will be 6.
   If we have to decrease one to a variable then it is called as decrement.
    example: int a = 5; a--; // new value of "a" will be 4.
