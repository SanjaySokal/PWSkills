1. Static is a keyword which is used at that place where there is no need to create an object.

    public class FirseProgramm {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            displayHello();
        }

        public static void displayHello() {
            System.out.println("Printing in displayHello() function");
        }
    }

2. The Java ClassLoader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine

3. No, we cannot make a local variable to static.

4. The static block always execute first before main() method because the compiler stores them in memory at the time of class loading and before the object creation.

5. Because a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class.

6. Because it executes the code during the class loading in memory.

7. Instance variables are created when an object is created by the use of the new keyword but static variables are created during the class loading in memory.

8. A static method is a class method and a non-static method is an instance method.
