1. Multithreading: It is the programming concept in which we can process multiple tasks parallely. It save our computer power and runmultiple tasks parallely.

2.
    a. Minimized system resource usage
    b. Program structure simplification
    c. Better communication

3. A thread in Java is the direction or path in which a program is being executed.

4.  
    a. By extending Thread class.
    b. By implementing Runnable interface.

5. Process is the program under action whereas a thread is the smallest segment of instructions that can be handled independently by a scheduler.

6.
public class TestDaemonThread1 extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        if (Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()) {
            System.out.println("daemon thread work");
        } else {
            System.out.println("user thread work");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TestDaemonThread1 t1 = new TestDaemonThread1();
        TestDaemonThread1 t2 = new TestDaemonThread1();
        TestDaemonThread1 t3 = new TestDaemonThread1();

        t1.setDaemon(true);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}

7. Wait and Sleep are the methods used to pause a process for few seconds and go the thread in the waiting state, respectively.
