1. A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.

2. Constructor chaining is the process of calling a sequence of constructors.

3. Yes we can call subclass constructor from a superclass constructor.

4. It will give us an error because an constructor cannot return any value.

5. The constructor which don't recieve any arguments or any parameter while creating object of that particular class.

6. No-args constructor is also called as a default constructor so their is no difference between them.

7. We need constructor overloading when we have to pass different parameters to the constructor.

8. Defult constructor is the constructor which will be created automatically by the compiler or we create it when we create the object of the class which don't recieve any arguments.

    public class Testing {
        Testing() {
            System.out.println("This is an default constructor");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Testing testing = new Testing();
        }
    }
